Just a little trip down memory lane :)

## Description

When I was 13, I wrote a demo for PC called "3D Overload". It was written in a language called [Blitz BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitz_BASIC), which was basically a pretty standard BASIC dialect with a built-in API for doing 2D graphics and sound. This made it an ideal language for a younger me to learn the basics of programming and graphics through making games and demos.

Recently, I rediscovered the source to this demo on the [Dark Bit Factory](http://www.dbfinteractive.com/forum/index.php?topic=4107.msg54994#msg54994) forums (which I frequented in those days) and thought it might be fun to try and get the source to compile again - by **writing my own Blitz BASIC compiler/interpreter** :D

So, that's what this is. Of course, it's one of those "I'm bored on Sunday and want to start a new project" kind of things, so I don't expect to ever finish it or anything. But it's fun to play with this old stuff for sure :)
